This project demonstrates **dynamic correlations in time series** using Python. Time series correlations are rarely static, and understanding their evolution can reveal hidden patterns, causal relationships, and temporal dependencies.  

Two related signals are simulated:  
- **Series A** – base signal  
- **Series B** – influenced by Series A with added noise  

A **rolling correlation** tracks how their relationship changes over time.  

## 🔹 Features

- **Line Plot Animation**: Shows Series A and B evolving together with rolling correlation.

- **Heatmap Animation**: Displays a 2×2 correlation matrix updating dynamically.

- Demonstrates causal relationships, temporal patterns, and real-time correlation analysis.
